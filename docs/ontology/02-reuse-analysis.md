# Step 2: Ontology Reuse Analysis - Consider Existing Ontologies ♻️

> **Methodology Reference**: Noy & McGuinness (2000) - Step 2 of the 7-step iterative ontology development process

## Strategic Approach

**🚀 Innovation-First Strategy**: Build core innovation rapidly, then selectively integrate standard ontology elements where they add value without slowing development.

**📈 Incremental Integration**: Use elements "just as needed" and grow step by step, focusing on immediate value delivery.

2. **Value Addition**: Does it provide significant functionality we'd otherwise build?
3. **Maintenance Burden**: How much ongoing effort is required?
4. **Industry Alignment**: Is it widely used in semiconductor manufacturing?
5. **AI Agent Support**: Does it enhance autonomous decision-making capabilities?
6. **Integration Complexity**: How difficult is it to integrate with our custom models?
