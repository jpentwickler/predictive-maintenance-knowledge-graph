# Ontology Development Documentation

This directory contains the complete documentation for the predictive maintenance knowledge graph ontology development, following the Noy & McGuinness (2000) 7-step methodology.

## Documentation Structure

### Step 1: ‚úÖ Domain Analysis - COMPLETE
**File**: [01-domain-analysis.md](01-domain-analysis.md)

**Status**: Complete  
**Last Updated**: July 18, 2025

Comprehensive analysis defining:
- Primary domain: Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Predictive Maintenance with AI-Driven OEE Optimization
- 14 critical sub-domains from semiconductor operations to stakeholder management
- Core competency questions for AI agent decision support
- Success metrics and validation criteria

### Step 2: üöß Consider Reuse - IN PROGRESS
**File**: [02-reuse-analysis.md](02-reuse-analysis.md)

**Status**: Pending  
**Target Areas**:
- SEMI standards for semiconductor manufacturing
- ISA-95 for manufacturing operations management
- MIMOSA OSA-EAI for condition monitoring
- Industry 4.0 ontologies for AI-driven manufacturing
- Asset management standards (ISO 55000)

### Step 3: üìù Enumerate Terms - PLANNED
**File**: [03-terminology.md](03-terminology.md)

**Status**: Planned  
**Target Areas**:
- Equipment terminology (vacuum dry pumps, sensors, components)
- Manufacturing concepts (OEE, yield, throughput, cycle time)
- Risk assessment vocabulary (probabilities, classifications, thresholds)
- AI agent concepts (decision trees, escalation, learning)

### Step 4: üè¢ Define Classes - PLANNED
**File**: [04-classes-hierarchy.md](04-classes-hierarchy.md)

**Status**: Planned  
**Target Areas**:
- Equipment hierarchy (tools, pumps, sensors, components)
- Manufacturing entities (wafers, lots, processes, recipes)
- Risk and reliability classes
- Reporting and communication entities

### Step 5: üè∑Ô∏è Define Properties - PLANNED
**File**: [05-properties.md](05-properties.md)

**Status**: Planned  
**Target Areas**:
- Equipment properties (age, health index, telemetry readings)
- Manufacturing properties (OEE metrics, yield rates, cycle times)
- Risk properties (probabilities, classifications, trends)
- Relationship properties (dependencies, correlations, impacts)

### Step 6: üîí Define Constraints - PLANNED
**File**: [06-constraints.md](06-constraints.md)

**Status**: Planned  
**Target Areas**:
- Data type constraints (numeric ranges, categorical values)
- Cardinality constraints (one-to-many relationships)
- Business rule constraints (scheduling, resource allocation)
- AI agent decision constraints (escalation rules, thresholds)

### Step 7: üìä Create Instances - PLANNED
**File**: [07-instances.md](07-instances.md)

**Status**: Planned  
**Target Areas**:
- Sample equipment instances (specific pumps, tools, sensors)
- Risk assessment examples (actual probability calculations)
- Service plan instances (maintenance schedules, resource allocations)
- Report templates and stakeholder profiles

## Validation Checkpoints

Each step includes validation against:
- ‚úÖ **Source Requirements**: Alignment with Notion workspace analysis
- ‚úÖ **AI Agent Needs**: Support for autonomous decision making
- ‚úÖ **OEE Objectives**: Contribution to overall equipment effectiveness
- ‚úÖ **Semiconductor Context**: Fit with manufacturing environment
- ‚úÖ **Stakeholder Requirements**: Meeting communication and reporting needs

## Review Process

- **Development Phase**: Monthly reviews
- **Production Phase**: Quarterly reviews
- **Major Changes**: Immediate stakeholder notification
- **Performance Validation**: Continuous monitoring against success metrics
