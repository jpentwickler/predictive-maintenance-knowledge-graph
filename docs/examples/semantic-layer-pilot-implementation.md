# MOVED TO NEW LOCATION

This file has been moved to: [examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/pilot-implementation.md](../../examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/pilot-implementation.md)

## New Unified Examples Structure

The examples have been reorganized to provide clear progression:

- **[examples/README.md](../../examples/README.md)** → Enhanced overview with v1.0/v2.0 progression path
- **[examples/v1.0-core/](../../examples/v1.0-core/)** → Core implementation examples (P002 pump)
- **[examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/](../../examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/)** → Semantic enhancement examples (including this pilot)
- **[examples/competency-questions-validation.md](../../examples/competency-questions-validation.md)** → Validation documentation

## Clear Learning Path

The new structure provides the recommended progression:
1. **Start with v1.0 Core** → Understand operational foundation
2. **Study Competency Validation** → See how system meets business requirements  
3. **Advance to v2.0 Semantic** → Learn how semantic intelligence enhances AI capabilities
4. **Apply Integration Patterns** → Use examples for your own implementations

Please use the new location for the complete semantic layer pilot implementation example.
