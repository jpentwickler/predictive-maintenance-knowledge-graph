# MOVED TO NEW LOCATION

This directory has been moved to: [examples/](../../examples/)

## New Unified Examples Structure

The examples have been reorganized under `/examples/` to provide clear progression:

- **[examples/README.md](../../examples/README.md)** → Enhanced overview with v1.0/v2.0 progression path
- **[examples/v1.0-core/](../../examples/v1.0-core/)** → Core implementation examples (P002 pump)
- **[examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/](../../examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/)** → Semantic enhancement examples
- **[examples/competency-questions-validation.md](../../examples/competency-questions-validation.md)** → Validation documentation

## Benefits of New Structure

✅ **Clear Learning Path**: v1.0 operational excellence → v2.0 semantic intelligence  
✅ **GitHub Convention**: Examples at root level for better discoverability  
✅ **Logical Separation**: Examples separate from formal documentation  
✅ **Link Preservation**: Maintains existing external links to `/examples`

Please use the new unified examples structure for all future reference.
