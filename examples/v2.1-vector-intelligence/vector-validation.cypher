/*
VALIDATION SCRIPT COMPLETED

This comprehensive validation covers:
✅ Prerequisites (v1.0 and v2.0 layer integrity)
✅ Vector layer structure and completeness
✅ Data quality and embedding text richness
✅ Concept-vector mapping accuracy
✅ Hybrid retrieval capability testing
✅ Business context accessibility
✅ Index status and performance readiness
✅ Storage and capacity analysis
✅ Overall system health assessment

INTERPRETING RESULTS:
- ✅ PASS: Component working correctly
- ⚠️  WARNING: Component working but could be improved
- ❌ FAIL: Component missing or broken

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:
1. "Vector structure incomplete" → Run create-vector-layer.cypher
2. "Embeddings missing" → Run semantic-vectorization.py with OpenAI API key
3. "Prerequisites missing" → Ensure v1.0 and v2.0 layers are implemented
4. "Limited business context" → Verify v2.0 semantic enhancement is complete

FOR SUPPORT:
Review the validation output above and check the implementation guide
