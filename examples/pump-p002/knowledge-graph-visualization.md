# MOVED TO NEW LOCATION

This file has been moved to: [examples/v1.0-core/knowledge-graph-visualization.md](../v1.0-core/knowledge-graph-visualization.md)

## New Unified Examples Structure

The examples directory has been reorganized to provide clear progression:

- **examples/v1.0-core/** → Core implementation examples (formerly pump-p002/)
- **examples/v2.0-semantic-layer/** → Semantic enhancement examples
- **examples/competency-questions-validation.md** → Validation documentation

This provides a clear learning path from v1.0 operational excellence to v2.0 semantic intelligence.

Please use the new location for the complete P002 knowledge graph visualization and analysis.
